            If I activate the mantle while on the ground I get the normal movement speed and fly slow in x and y axis and normal in y but if I activate it in the air I fly as normal.
            Needs to save, load and unload data so the player doesn't fall.
            or suffocate when logging back in and it doesn't keep its "effect" even if it is removed.
            Might need to deal with capabilities.
